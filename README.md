# Sentiment-Analysis
## Overview
The Sentiment Analysis Project is a Python-based application designed to analyze the sentiment of text data. It provides a simple yet powerful tool for classifying text into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment categories. This project aims to assist users in understanding and interpreting the sentiment expressed in textual data, which can be valuable for various applications such as customer feedback analysis, social media sentiment monitoring, and opinion mining.

## Features
Text Preprocessing: The project preprocesses text data by tokenizing, removing stopwords, and lemmatizing words to prepare it for sentiment analysis.

Sentiment Classification: Utilizing machine learning algorithms, the project classifies text data into three sentiment categories: positive, negative, or neutral.

User-friendly Interface: The project provides a straightforward interface for users to input text data and obtain sentiment predictions quickly and easily.
